      "Supergravity is now mostly known as an ingredient of superstring theory,\n",
      "the theory that tells that the elementary particles are vibrations of a\n",
      "fundamental string. This theory offers a magnificent framework to study\n",
      "all particles and all interactions. Since 1994 there is an extended\n",
      "framework connecting all the superstring theories and supergravities,\n",
      "which is called M-theory. Many unexpected connections now emerge every\n",
      "year from the study of superstrings and supergravities, increasing\n",
      "continuously our capabilities to construct realistic models, to perform\n",
      "calculations on gauge theories, to discuss models of cosmology and to\n",
      "connect many different aspects of our knowledge of physics and\n",
      "mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many applications of string theory we just need to know the structure\n",
      "of supergravity theories. The elementary particles that emerge from any\n",
      "superstring theory and that are not hidden to us by being extremely\n",
      "massive, nicely fit in supergravity theories. In this review, we will\n",
      "consider supergravity in its own right, i.e.\\ independent of its role in\n",
      "superstring theory. We will consider the supergravities with fields that\n",
      "occur in the action up to two derivatives. This corresponds only to the\n",
      "first order in an $\\alpha '$ perturbation theory of superstrings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The part of the theory that describes the spinless fields is very\n",
      "illustrative for the structure of such a supergravity theory. These\n",
      "scalar fields determine the vacua of the theory. In the context of\n",
      "superstring theory they are the moduli of deformations of the\n",
      "compactifying dimensions. The scalar fields define a geometry, the\n",
      "structure of which determines also a large part of the full action due to\n",
      "the supersymmetry relations. We will at the end of this review consider\n",
      "these geometries. It turns out that the richest geometric structures are\n",
      "those that appear when there are 8 supersymmetries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next section, we will review the basic ingredients of supergravity\n",
      "theory at the bosonic side: the fields that are mostly $n$-forms with\n",
      "gauge transformations, and dualities between their field strengths. The\n",
      "mechanism of compensating fields will be shown and we will show how\n",
      "Poincar{\\'e} gravity is obtained as a gauge theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fermionic side is introduced in section~\\ref{ss:Clifford}. The\n",
      "possibilities for supersymmetries are determined by a table of Clifford\n",
      "algebras with specific properties. The classification of these lead to a\n",
      "map of possible supergravities and supersymmetric theories that is\n",
      "explained in section~\\ref{ss:mapsusy}.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can divide the discussion on supergravity theories in 4 steps. First,\n",
      "in section~\\ref{ss:salgebra}, we consider the algebra of the\n",
      "transformations that leave the action invariant. We discuss the\n",
      "super-Poincar{\\'e} algebra, but also generalizations as central charges, the\n",
      "(anti-)de Sitter algebra, the conformal algebra and their supersymmetric\n",
      "extensions. Apart from the spacetime symmetries and the supersymmetries,\n",
      "other bosonic gauge symmetries play a role. In particular there is the\n",
      "R-symmetry, for which the supersymmetries form a non-trivial\n",
      "representation. At the end of this section we show how these algebras are\n",
      "used in constructing supergravity theories\n",
      "\n",
      "The second step (section~\\ref{ss:multiplets}) brings in the fields as\n",
      "representations of the algebra. Such a set of fields is a\n",
      "\\emph{multiplet}, and there is a balance between bosonic and fermionic\n",
      "fields with an \\emph{on-shell counting}, but often also with an\n",
      "\\emph{off-shell counting}. We first explain this difference, and then\n",
      "discuss the most important multiplet in various dimensions and with\n",
      "various supersymmetry extensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In section~\\ref{ss:actions} we look at the third step: the construction\n",
      "of an action and its properties. We explain the duality transformations\n",
      "in 4 dimensions, and how the kinetic terms of the scalars determine a\n",
      "scalar geometry. We summarize how isometries generalize to hidden\n",
      "symmetries of the action, often related to duality transformations, and\n",
      "how a subgroup of them can be gauged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final step (section~\\ref{ss:solutions}) involves the properties of\n",
      "some solutions of the supergravity theories. The concept of BPS solutions\n",
      "will appear, with charges that are at the boundary of an allowed domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, the scalars of supergravity theories define a geometry, and\n",
      "their kinetic terms in the action determine a metric. Often these are\n",
      "symmetric spaces. An interesting subclass of supergravities, those with 8\n",
      "supersymmetries, define \\emph{special geometries}, which can be real,\n",
      "K{\\\"a}hler or quaternionic manifolds. These geometric aspects are reviewed in\n",

      "content Introduction Supergravity is now mostly known as an ingredient of superstring theory the theory that tells that the elementary particles are vibrations of a fundamental string This theory offers a magnificent framework to study all particles and all interactions Since 1994 there is an extended framework connecting all the superstring theories and supergravities which is called Mtheory Many unexpected connections now emerge every year from the study of superstrings and supergravities increasing continuously our capabilities to construct realistic models to perform calculations on gauge theories to discuss models of cosmology and to connect many different aspects of our knowledge of physics and mathematics For many applications of string theory we just need to know the structure of supergravity theories The elementary particles that emerge from any superstring theory and that are not hidden to us by being extremely massive nicely fit in supergravity theories In this review we will consider supergravity in its own right ie independent of its role in superstring theory We will consider the supergravities with fields that occur in the action up to two derivatives This corresponds only to the first order in an alpha  perturbation theory of superstrings The part of the theory that describes the spinless fields is very illustrative for the structure of such a supergravity theory These scalar fields determine the vacua of the theory In the context of superstring theory they are the moduli of deformations of the compactifying dimensions The scalar fields define a geometry the structure of which determines also a large part of the full action due to the supersymmetry relations We will at the end of this review consider these geometries It turns out that the richest geometric structures are those that appear when there are 8 supersymmetries In the next section we will review the basic ingredients of supergravity theory at the bosonic side the fields that are mostly nforms with gauge transformations and dualities between their field strengths The mechanism of compensating fields will be shown and we will show how Poincare gravity is obtained as a gauge theory The fermionic side is introduced in sectionrefssClifford The possibilities for supersymmetries are determined by a table of Clifford algebras with specific properties The classification of these lead to a map of possible supergravities and supersymmetric theories that is explained in sectionrefssmapsusy We can divide the discussion on supergravity theories in 4 steps First in sectionrefsssalgebra we consider the algebra of the transformations that leave the action invariant We discuss the superPoincare algebra but also generalizations as central charges the antide Sitter algebra the conformal algebra and their supersymmetric extensions Apart from the spacetime symmetries and the supersymmetries other bosonic gauge symmetries play a role In particular there is the Rsymmetry for which the supersymmetries form a nontrivial representation At the end of this section we show how these algebras are used in constructing supergravity theories The second step sectionrefssmultiplets brings in the fields as representations of the algebra Such a set of fields is a emphmultiplet and there is a balance between bosonic and fermionic fields with an emphonshell counting but often also with an emphoffshell counting We first explain this difference and then discuss the most important multiplet in various dimensions and with various supersymmetry extensions In sectionrefssactions we look at the third step the construction of an action and its properties We explain the duality transformations in 4 dimensions and how the kinetic terms of the scalars determine a scalar geometry We summarize how isometries generalize to hidden symmetries of the action often related to duality transformations and how a subgroup of them can be gauged The final step sectionrefsssolutions involves the properties of some solutions of the supergravity theories The concept of BPS solutions will appear with charges that are at the boundary of an allowed domain As mentioned the scalars of supergravity theories define a geometry and their kinetic terms in the action determine a metric Often these are symmetric spaces An interesting subclass of supergravities those with 8 supersymmetries define emphspecial geometries which can be real Kahler or quaternionic manifolds These geometric aspects are reviewed in sectionrefssscalGeom before concluding with some final remarks in sectionrefssfinal sectionThe ingredients fields and gauge symmetry labelssbosIngred The bosonic fields that occur in supergravity theories are mostly antisymmetric tensors ie components of nforms with gauge symmetries There are exceptions but for most theories one can restrict to these types of bosonic fields We will repeat the relevant general formulae for gauge theories These fields determine massless particles Masses for fields with spin 1 or higher appear by considering spontaneously broken symmetries The construction of Poincare gravity as a gauge theory needs already a special treatment Symmetries in field theories should be distinguished in different categories The simplest ones are emphrigid symmetries These are transformations of the fields with a parameter say Lambda  that is the same everywhere in spacetime Eg a rotation of the reference frame is such a transformation The second type are the emphlocal symmetries or emphgauge symmetries where this parameter can be taken differently in any point of spacetime Lambda x where x denotes the spacetime point Furthermore one should say what is left invariant under symmetries One can consider symmetries of the action symmetries of field equations transforming a field equation in a linear combination of field equations or symmetries of solutions A symmetry of the action will also be a symmetry of the field equations but the reverse is not necessarily true Such symmetries are not necessarily symmetries of a solution and that is the concept of a emphspontaneously broken symmetry We now restrict ourselves to symmetries of the action When we consider a rigid symmetry and try to promote it to a local symmetry the action S will in general not be invariant due to terms that show the xdependence of the parameter ie delta S is proportional to partial mu Lambda x beginequation delta Lambda  S int rmdDx Jmupartial mu Lambda x labeldelSJdLambda endequation for a Jmu  Noether current mu01ldots D1 labels spacetime coordinates To compensate these terms one needs a field Amu x gauge field with beginequation Srm new S  intrmdDx Jmu Amu qquad delta Amux partial mu Lambda x labelSwithA endequation This is the first step in an iterative procedure to construct invariant actions Noether procedure The simplest example of a gauge field is the Maxwell field that appears when promoting phase transformations of complex fields that are proportional to their electric charges to a local symmetry The gauge field induces a force between the particles that transform under the symmetry Apart from the scalar fields all bosonic fields that appear here are gauge fields The Maxwell field above can be seen as a 1form AAmu rmd xmu  and its transformation is delta Armd Lambda The other bosonic fields will be nforms An with a symmetry parameter that is an n1 form delta Anrmd Lambdan1 Not all the components of Lambdan1frac1n1 Lambda mu 1ldots mu n1rmd xmu 1ldots rmd xmu n1 are independent symmetries as all transformations where Lambdan1rmd Lambda primen2 are not effective Counting the remaining gaugeinvariant components of an n form gives beginequation Dchoose n  D choose n1  D choose n2  ldots  D1choose n labelcompnform endequation the number of components of an nform in D1 dimensions This is a general feature the independent components form a representation of SOD1 If furthermore the field equations of massless fields are used the independent components form representations of SOD2 The former is called emphoffshell counting while the latter is called emphonshell counting  The number of offshell components is also equal to the number of components of a massive field Indeed the massive physical fields are also characterized by SOD1 representations as that is the little group for a massive state while SOD2 is the little group of massless states The gauge invariant degrees of freedom for an n form reside in an n1form field strength Fn1rmd An This obviously satisfies a Bianchi identity rmd Fn10 while for the standard Lagrangian proportional to Fmu 1ldots mu n1Fmu 1ldots mu n1  the field equation gives rmd F0 This shows that  F satisfies the same equations as a Bianchi identity for a Dn1form field strength Thus it can be considered as the field strength of a Dn2form This shows the emphduality between nforms and Dn2forms Eg in 4 dimensions this shows that a 2form gives physically the same as a scalar and we can thus restrict ourselves to scalars and vectors However the arguments above are only true for the simplest actions ie with abelian gauge fields In nonabelian field theories antisymmetric tensors can lead to nonequivalent theories The duality transformations on vectors is a emphselfduality between the components of the field strengths Fmu nu  and transforms electric in magnetic components The usual gauge symmetries with 1form gauge fields are the most important ingredients of supergravity theories For a set of gauge transformations labelled by an index A we write the transformations as deltaA Lambda A where Lambda Ax denote the parameters They form an algebra as

as a redefinition of the gauge field BlueAmu  to BlueAmu frac1Mpartial mu Redphi This is a general fact gauge fixing can also be described as a field redefinition In principle the gauge symmetry is never broken but acts only on the field that is not present anymore in the action after this redefinition If we try to mimic the gauge theory procedure for gravity we should consider the Poincare group consisting of translations OliveGreenPa and Lorentz rotations OliveGreenMab The indices ab also run from 0 to D1 as the coordinates of the spacetime manifold but indicate vectors or tensors in the tangent space Each of these should get a gauge field leading to the scheme beginequation beginarraycchline OliveGreenPa  OliveGreenMab  hline Blueemu a  Blueomega muab  hline endarray

This is now a function of the vielbein with the expression known in Einsteins theory The transformation of Blueomega muab  is modified with respect to the one that would directly follow fromrefcovder You can see this either from the fact that the transformation of the spin connection now follows from its new definition or from the fact that the transformation should be adapted such thatrefconstrRP is invariant This deforms the algebra The result is very nice the translation operation is replaced by a general coordinate transformation on all fields In this way a gauge theory of general coordinate transformations is obtained and this is Einsteins theory sectionThe guide Clifford algebra representations labelssClifford We now turn our attention to the fermions Therefore we first of all have to know which Clifford representations we can use This information determines also the amount of supersymmetry that can be present in any dimension What do we have to know Essentially we need the answers to 3 questions bitemenumerate item How large are the smallest spinors in each dimension item What are the reality conditions item Which bispinors are antisymmetric eitemenumerate The latter question is important to know what can occur in a superalgebra Supersymmetries are transformations with a spinor parameter epsilon  Eg a scalar field phi x transforms in a fermion psi x depending on this parameter beginequation delta epsilon phix bar epsilon psi x labelsusyscalar endequation The algebra of supersymmetry is that a commutator of two such transformations leads to general coordinate transformations beginequation leftdelta epsilon 2delta epsilon 1right phi xbar epsilon 1gamma mu epsilon 2partial mu phix xi mupartial mu phix labelsusyalgscalar endequation For consistency the bispinor ximu bar epsilon 1gamma mu epsilon 2 should be antisymmetric in the interchange of epsilon1 and epsilon 2 The analysis of gamma matrices and spinors in different dimensions can be found in many places We refer especially tocitesection3VanProeyen1999ni which has all the arguments in the conventions that are used here Of course that material is not original and is rather a convenient reformulation of earlier works Another recent approach to the theory of spinors has been presented inciteDAuria2000ec which is convenient also for understanding the supersymmetry algebras We now summarize the relevant results A priori a spinor Psi  has 2mathoprm IntnolimitsD2 components One can define a product of all gamma matrices gamma equiv rmimathoprm IntnolimitsD21gamma 0gamma 1ldots gamma D1 which squares to unity  Note that though inciteVanProeyen1999ni the formulae occur for an arbitrary number of timelike dimensions here we assume always just one timelike direction ie the gamma matrices satisfy beginequation gamma mu gamma nu ft12left gamma mu gamma nu gamma nu gamma mu right eta mu nu mathoprm diagnolimits 11ldots 1 labeldefgamma endequation For odd dimensions gamma pm unity  but for even dimensions it is nontrivial allowing nontrivial left and right projections beginequation PLft12unity gamma qquad PRft12unity gamma  labelPLPR endequation emphWeyl spinors are the reduced spinors under such a projection thus eg a lefthanded spinor which satisfies PLPsi Psi  This concept chirality thus only makes sense in even dimensions One may consider the possibilities for reducing the complex spinors to spinors that satisfy a reality condition Psi BPsi  for a suitable matrix B This should be consistent with the Lorentz algebra which is only possible in some dimensions and this depends also on the spacetime signature The corresponding reduced spinors are called emphMajorana spinors If this is not possible one needs a doublet of spinors to define reality conditions In that case the reality conditions do not really reduce the number of independent components of a spinor but the formulation with doublets of real spinors shows more explicitly the symmetry structure These spinors are denoted as emphsymplectic Majorana spinors The reality condition is not always compatible with the Weyl projection If the reality condition can be imposed on Weyl spinors the corresponding irreducible representations of the Lorentz algebra are denoted as emphMajoranaWeyl spinors and have only 2D21 components This leads to tablereftblspinors begintablehtbp

are always two possibilities for reality conditions and we give here the one that includes the 1 as this is the most useful one for supersymmetry in view ofrefsusyalgscalar Consider as an example supersymmetry in 5 dimensions The fact that 1 does not appear in the list of antisymmetric bispinors implies that we cannot have an algebra as inrefsusyalgscalar We need anyway for the reality

dimensions and supersymmetries labelssmapsusy Tablereftblmapsusy gives an overview on supersymmetric theories in Minkowski spacetimes and with positive definite kinetic terms The most relevant source in this respect is the paper of StrathdeeciteStrathdee1987jr that analyses the representations of supersymmetries Supersymmetric field theories of this type in 4 dimensions are restricted to fields with spins leq 2 This is the restriction to Nleq 8 or up to 32 supersymmetries as an elementary real spinor in 4 dimensions has 4 components see tablereftblspinors The same table shows that one can not have more than 11 dimensions if the supersymmetries are restricted to 32 at least in spacetimes of Minkowski signatureciteNahm1978tg  We are considering here the supersymmetries that square to general coordinate transformations Thus not eg the special supersymmetries in the superconformal algebra which have a different role The 11dimensional theoryciteCremmer1978km is the basis of Mtheory and is therefore indicated as M in the table Going down vertically in the table is obtained by KaluzaKlein reduction That means that one splits all the fields in representations of the lower dimensional Lorentz group Eg the spinors of the 11dimensional Mtheory split in one righthanded and one lefthanded spinor This is the theory of the massless sector of IIA string theory and that is why we have indicated it as IIAciteCampbell1984zcHuq1985imGiani1984wc The massless sector of IIB theory involves doublets of spinors of the same chirality thus also with 32 real supersymmetries That theoryciteSchwarz1983waSchwarz1983qrHowe1984sr is not the dimensional reduction of an 11dimensional theory as indicated by its place in the table Elementary supersymmetric theories in 10 dimensions involve only 16 supersymmetries They appear in superstring theories with open and closed strings Apart from the supergravity multiplet which involves the graviton one can also have a vector multiplet The existence of the simplest matter multiplets representations of supersymmetry that do not involve the graviton is indicated in the table Vector multiplets involve a vector an elementary spinor and possibly scalars Tensor multiplets involve antisymmetric tensors Amu nu  As explained in sectionrefssbosIngred for dimensions 5 and 4 these are dual to vectors and scalars Therefore tensor multiplets are not explicitly indicated for these lower dimensions Also various representations of the same physical onshell theory are not indicated The nonAbelian aspects are not indicated either Eg the tensor multiplets in 5 dimensions are only dual to vector multiplets when the gauge group is Abelian but we do not indicate it separately here One can have theories with these matter multiplets also for ungauged supersymmetry ie rigid supersymmetry Rigid supersymmetry is only possible with up to 16 supersymmetries Again this can be understood in 4 dimensions because for N4 one needs fields of spinft32 The latter are in field theory only possible when they are gauge fields of a local supersymmetry gravitinos which then need gravitons for the gauge fields of the translations that appear in the commutator of two supersymmetries In the dimensions lower than 10 we indicate the theories by a number N that indicates the symmetry group rotating different supersymmetries The structure will be shown explicitly in the next section For 6 dimensions as in 10 dimensions there are spinors of different chirality and one has to distinguish the number of left and righthanded spinors The simplest case is with 8 supersymmetries They have to be all of the same chirality The theory is then called 10 and would be N2 in the terminology used in 5 dimensions With 16 supersymmetries one can have 11 or 20 These are the analogues of IIA and IIB respectively in 10 dimensions For more supersymmetries there is a subtlety The 21 and 22 theories can be constructed using a metric tensor gmu nu x For the 40 31citeTownsend1984xt or 30 theories this field is not presentciteHull2000zn but is replaced by a more complicated representation of the Lorentz group Thus these theories are different in the sense that they are not based on a dynamical metric tensor If one constructs in 4 dimensions a field theory with N7 then it automatically has an eighth local supersymmetry That is why it is not mentioned in the table Similarly if one constructs a rigid supersymmetric theory with N3 it automatically has a fourth supersymmetry However in this case there is the possibility of having only three of the four local Thus N3 is only meaningful in supergravity This explains the lowest line of the table Finally let me remark that the vectors of the supergravity theories can be gauge vectors for a gauge symmetry that rotates the supersymmetries The last years various new results have been obtained in this directionciteGheerardyn2001jjHull2002wgBergshoeff2002mb Andrianopoli2002mfHull2002cvBergshoeff2002nvAlonsoAlberca2002tb deWit2002vt A complete catalogue of theories is not yet known However we believe that all supersymmetric field theories with a finite number of fields and field equations that are at most quadratic in derivatives belong to one of the entries in tablereftblmapsusy sectionStep 1 Supersymmetry and gauge algebra labelsssalgebra After this overview of possibilities we will now give elementary aspects of the construction of supersymmetric theories The first basic concept is the symmetry group First we clarify the relation between transformations and generators We have already written transformations of fields eg inrefsusyscalar This change of a field is proportional to a parameter epsilon  and we can writefootnoteWe sometimes use spinor indices alpha ldots  in this section For details on the notation seeciteVanProeyen1999ni beginequation delta OliveGreenepsilon OliveGreenepsilon alpha BlueQalpha labeldeltaEpsQ endequation ie the product of the parameter with an operation called the generator of the supersymmetry This operation is for supersymmetry also a fermionic object such that the elementary change of a field is of

can consider four kinds of generalizations The first one is the possibility of central charges as found in the classical work of HaagLopuszanskiSohniusciteHaag1975qh The simplest example is in N2 whererefextSUSY45 can be extended to beginequation left BlueQialpha BlueQjbeta right  gamma mu alpha beta delta ijOliveGreenPmu varepsilon ijleft cal Calpha beta RedZ1 gamma 5alpha beta RedZ2right labelD4N2Z endequation The generators Z1 and Z2 commute with everything else and are thus really central They play an important role when looking for supersymmetric solutions of the theory But the name central charges has been generalized to include other generators that can appear in the anticommutator of supersymmetries Eg in D11 the properties of the spinors allow us to extend the anticommutator ascitevanHolten1982mx beginequation leftBlueQalpha BlueQbeta  rightgammamu alpha beta  OliveGreenPmu gamma mu nu  alpha beta RedZmu nu gamma mu1cdots mu5  alpha beta RedZmu1cdots mu5  labelQQD11 endequation The allowed structures on the righthand side are determined by the last entry in tablereftblspinors remember that this is modulo 4 which thus allows the 5index object The central charges RedZ are no longer Lorentz scalars and thus do not commute with the Lorentz generators They are therefore not central in the grouptheoretical meaning of the word but play in the physical context the same role as the ones inrefD4N2Z and therefore got the same name A second generalization is the extension of the Poincare group to the anti de Sitter group The spacetime with a cosmological constant is a curved space which means that translations do not commute but satisfy an algebra beginequation left OliveGreenPmu OliveGreenPnu right mp frac12R2OliveGreenMmu nu  labelAdSalgebra endequation where R is related to the inverse of the cosmological constant The sign inrefAdSalgebra determines the sign of the cosmological constant and correspondingly whether the algebra of translations and Lorentz rotations is SOD1 or SOD12 The first one is the de Sitter algebra while the second one is the antide Sitter algebra Extending the first one to a superalgebra needs a noncompact Rsymmetry group which in turn needs negative kinetic terms of some of the fields an undesirable feature But supersymmetric extensions of antide Sitter algebras are wellknown see the classical work of NahmciteNahm1978tg or a recent investigation inciteDAuria2000ec The third generalization is to superconformal algebras The conformal group is the group consisting of translations BluePmu Lorentz rotations BlueMmu nu  dilatations BlueD and special conformal transformations BlueKmu which combine to SOD2 If one extends it with supersymmetries RedQi the algebra requires for consistency new special supersymmetries RedSi in the commutator QK and the Rsymmetry group mentioned above appears in the anticommutator of the RedQ and RedS supersymmetries The fourth generalization is to include extra YangMills YM gauge symmetries Indeed the spin1 fields that appear either in the supergravity multiplet or in the extra vector multiplets may gauge YM symmetries according to the principles expressed byrefcovder When the replacement of derivatives by covariant derivatives is performed everywhere it is clear that one will not obtain the commutator as inrefsusyalgscalar but rather beginequation left deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 1deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 2right Bluephi OliveGreenbar epsilon 1gamma mu OliveGreenepsilon 2Dmu Bluephi OliveGreenbar epsilon 1gamma mu

parameter OliveGreenbar epsilon 1gamma mu OliveGreenepsilon 2 BlueAmu I Therefore gamma mualpha beta  BlueAmu I is a fielddependent emphstructure function rather than a structure constant This type of algebra structure appears often in supersymmetry and is called a emphsoft algebra The adapted Jacobi identities then imply that more modifications to the algebra are necessary Eg in N2 where the vector multiplets contain scalars sigma I the algebra has an extra term beginequation left deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 1deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 2right Bluephi ldots  OliveGreenbar epsilon 1OliveGreenepsilon 2Bluesigma I TIBluephi labelQQextraT endequation When the fields sigma I have a nonzero value for a solution of the theory then the algebra that preserves this solution has the form ofrefD4N2Z ie with central charges This illustrates how the first generalization that we discussed above appears in solutions of the supergravity theories Also the second generalization superantide Sitter algebras occurs in solutions The third and fourth generalization on the other hand are important in constructing supergravity theories subsectionConstructionslabelssconstruction In constructing rigid supersymmetric theories we start from a rigid Poincare supersymmetry ie the Poincare symmetries supersymmetry and its R symmetries Then a YM gauge algebra can be addedfootnoteIn principle also gauge symmetries of antisymmetric tensors can be included which may also have an action on the other fields We neglect these here for simplicity but the principles are the same as for the YM symmetries gauged by vectors which are parts of a vector multiplet The algebra becomes then soft and the rigid supersymmetries mix with the local YM symmetries as shown inrefSUSYalgGauge In some cases the action can be invariant under rigid superconformal symmetries Central charges are not introduced by hand but may appear due to the mixing of supersymmetry with YM symmetries and nonzero vacuum expectation values of some fields seerefQQextraT To construct supergravity theories there is first a straightforward way superPoincare way One gauges gravity and supersymmetry The invariance requirements determine all the terms as well in the Lagrangian as in the transformation laws The alternative way called superconformal tensor calculus is particularly useful to construct theories with matter couplings ie where matter multiplets are coupled to supergravity The superPoincare construction leads to a lot of extra terms which can be better understood in the context of the superconformal tensor calculus The latter starts by gauging the full superconformal algebra This is a generalization of the method used to gauge the Poincare group at the end of sectionrefssbosIngred gauge fields are associated to all the symmetries as inrefgravitygaugef but some of these are dependent fields using constraints on curvatures as inrefconstrRP Then an action is constructed that is invariant under the superconformal symmetries but the symmetries that are superfluous are gaugefixed This is similar to the construction of the Lagrangian for a massive vector where inrefL10 we constructed an action invariant under a gauge symmetry which was then fixed to obtain the massive vector action inrefLmassive1 For the superconformal symmetry this means that dilatations special conformal transformations special supersymmetry and the Rsymmetry should be gaugefixed to obtain an action that is invariant under the superPoincare group We thus need fields that will not be physical as the scalar phi  inrefL10 but are emphcompensating for the symmetries in the superconformal algebra that do not belong to the superPoincare algebra They are part of emphcompensating multiplets as they have to be in supersymmetric representations Also the fourth generalization has to be considered in the construction of general actions vectors in the supergravity multiplet and vector multiplets can gauge an extra YM gauge group In the superPoincare construction one considers separately the Rsymmetries and other YM symmetries One has to define the action of Rsymmetry on all the fields in the theory In the superconformal tensor calculus only vectors of vector multiplets can gauge an extra gauge symmetry G commuting with supersymmetry But one of these vector multiplets may be the compensating multiplet mentioned above That means that some of its partners are fields that disappear by gauge conditions The vectors are the extra vectors that appear in the gravity multiplet from the superPoincare theory Also the Rsymmetry is already gauged in the superconformal context as it is part of the superconformal group but is afterwards gaugefixed However the gauge fixing condition may be not invariant under some of the extra YM gauge symmetries mixing Rsymmetry and G Schematically we have begineqnarray mboxsuperconformal including R  times   G nonumber  Downarrow  mboxgauge fixingnonumber

Rsymmetry sectionStep 2 Multiplets and their transformations labelssmultiplets We did already encounter multiplets in the previous sections especially in the overview sectionrefssmapsusy We now give some more details distinguishing on and offshell multiplets and then giving the properties of the unique multiplets when there are 32 supersymmetries the vector multiplets and the multiplets with spins ft120 for lower number of supersymmetries We first explain the concept of emphtrivial symmetries Consider the simple action for 2 scalar fields and a gauge invariance beginequation Sint rmd

algebrarefminSUSYalg is satisfied onshell ie when the field equations are imposed There is a possible improvement here we can include emphauxiliary fields Redh complex This means that we modify the

other Lagrangians invariant under the same transformation laws Indeed one can eg add to the Lagrangian a term beginequation cal Lmmleft BluezRedhBluezRedhBluebar chi chi right labelLchiralm endequation The Lagrangian is still invariant The field equation of the auxiliary field is now RedhmBluez which lead to massive scalar and spinor fields Of course in the formulation without auxiliary fields one has to modify the transformation laws to allow such an extension as the last term inrefalgChiral would not be a field equation any more Therefore when such a formalism with auxiliary fields is possible it is certainly easier to handle also for considering the quantum theory The formalism with auxiliary fields can also be obtained from the concept of superspace and superfields However unfortunately it is not always possible to obtain such auxiliary fields In general trivial symmetries can be considered as part of the full set of transformations of the theory and as such it makes sense to write the algebra beginequation left delta OliveGreenepsilon 1delta OliveGreenepsilon 2right Bluephii mboxminimal susy algebraRedeta ijOliveGreenepsilon 1epsilon 2fracdelta Sdelta Bluephi j labelalgWithTriv endequation When we can write the algebra without including the trivial symmetries the algebra is called a emphclosed supersymmetry algebra If the trivial symmetries enter the algebra then it is called an emphopen supersymmetry algebra In that case the algebra closes when the field equations are satisfied or when the infinite set of trivial symmetries are included Thus in this case the dynamics can be obtained already from the algebra of supersymmetry transformations before constructing the action The square of the supersymmetry operation is in the minimal algebrarefminSUSYalg a general coordinate transformation This is an invertible operation As the supersymmetry operation transforms boson in fermion states and viceversa one can conclude that the number of boson and fermion states should be the same This is thus true when the algebra of supersymmetries gives just OliveGreenP Eg with the transformationsreftransfosChiralM and algebrarefalgChiral we can apply this only for onshell states such that slashedpartial Bluechi 0 Then we count 2 bosonic states for the complex Bluez and the 4 fermionic components of Bluechi  are reduced to 2 by the field equation So we have a 22 onshell multiplet When the auxiliary field Redh is included the algebra is also satisfied offshell Thus we have in this case the 4 components of Bluechi  and Bluez and Redh give together also 4 components In this case we say that we have a 44 offshell multiplet These two ways of counting are called emphonshell counting and emphoffshell counting Let me finally remark that to have the minimal algebra we have to eliminate the extra gauge terms that we illustrated inrefSUSYalgGauge Thus we always have to subtract gauge degrees of freedom in all countings Eg a gauge vector in 4 dimensions would count offshell for 3 degrees of freedom and onshell for 2 degrees of freedom representation of SOD2 see sectionrefssbosIngred We now give some general facts about the most important multiplets in 4 dimensions The  emphpure supergravity multiplet is the set of fields that represents the spacetime susy algebra and has gauge fields for the supersymmetries The number of fields is given in

supersymmetry supergravity The vectors in the vector multiplets and those in the gravity multiplets can gauge an extra possibly nonAbelian gauge group In rigid supersymmetry one can only have compact gauge groups if one requires positive kinetic energies but in supergravity some noncompact gauge groups are possible without spoiling the positivity of the kinetic energies However the list of possible noncompact groups is restricted for any N A number of hypermultiplets N2 or chiral multiplets N1 may then form a representation of these gauge groups When there are 32 supersymmetries the multiplet is unique and this multiplet is only known onshell ie it is not known and there are nogo theorems how to add auxiliary fields to obtain offshell closure The basic multiplet in 11 dimensions

128128 multiplet Reducing this eg to D4 fields gives the N8 multiplet in tablereftblpureSGD4 With 16 supersymmetries rigid supersymmetry is possible One can have vector multiplets or tensor multiplets for 20 supersymmetry in 6 dimensions In D5 the tensor multiplets are dual to vector multiplets at the level of zero gauge coupling constant Gauging breaks this duality Supergravity theories with 16 supersymmetries may contain a number of these multiplets The model is fixed once one gives the number of matter multiplets and the gauging that is performed by the vectors Theories with 8 or 4 supersymmetries are not fixed by the discrete choices of number of multiplets and gauging In these cases the model depends on some functions that can vary by infinitesimal variations It is in these models that auxiliary fields are most useful Eg for the chiral multiplets that we mentioned before a holomorphic function OliveGreenWBluez can be introduced which may take arbitrary values determining

scalars see sectionrefssscalGeom sectionStep 3 Actions labelssactions The next step is the determination of the action There are some general properties of actions that we will show in this section The kinetic terms of the scalars determine a geometry There is also a potential for these scalars with properties that are determined by the supersymmetry The kinetic terms of the vectors introduce the duality symmetries which by supersymmetry imply symmetries on the full theory leading often to hidden symmetries of the scalar geometry The full action of a supergravity theory is very complicated It contains 4fermion couplings couplings between fermions and vectors as dipole moments ldots  We show here some general structure of the bosonic terms in 4 dimensions The theory containsfootnoteWe

Then there are the kinetic terms for the spin1 fields They depend on two tensor functions which we combine in a complex symmetric tensor Redcal NIJ This tensor in general is a function of the scalars in the theory The scalars have kinetic terms determined by a symmetric tensor Redguvvarphi They couple minimally to the vectors with a covariant derivative for the gauge symmetries as inrefcovder

there is the spacetime with coordinates xmu  mu 0123 On the other hand there is a manifold which we indicate as cal M with dimension equal to the number of scalars in the model The scalars Redvarphiu give a chart in this manifold The values of a scalar at a spacetime point x thus determine a submanifold of cal M parametrized by Redvarphiux The metric of spacetime is gmu nu xemu ax eta ab enu bx The metric on cal M is Redguvvarphi These have a different status While the latter is part of the definition of the theory gmu nu x is together with Redvarphiux a dynamical field On the other hand the induced metric on spacetime is Redguvvarphi partial mu Redvarphi upartial nu Redvarphi v at varphi varphi x and its contraction with the inverse spacetime metric and its determinant sqrtggmu nu  appears in the action The scalar manifold can have isometries ie symmetries of the induced metric rmd s2Redguvvarphi rmd Redvarphi urmd Redvarphi v Usually these symmetries are extended to a symmetry of the full action there are counterexamples but they are rare This group is then called the emphUduality group The scalars and the vectors are connected via the tensor RedmathcalNIJvarphi  Therefore the isometries act as duality transformations in the vector sector and as such must belong to the Symp2mmathbbR group in 4 dimensions This gives a restriction of possible Uduality groups which are for D4 restricted to be a subgroup of Symp2mmathbbR for scalars that belong to multiplets including vectors Actually to count the m vectors we have to include those of the gravity multiplet This is natural in superconformal tensor calculus where these vectors belong to vector multiplets of which part of the fields are compensating fields see sectionrefssconstruction A subgroup of the isometry group at most of dimension m can then be gauged This means that the vectors couple to the scalars in the covariant derivative using inrefcovder the transformations of the scalars under these isometries There are more corrections due to this gauging in the fermionic sector We will give more details on the geometries in sectionrefssscalGeom but first finish the overview of the different steps of the analysis of supersymmetric theories sectionStep 4 Solutions and their symmetry labelsssolutions We usually look for solutions with vanishing fermions This is often motivated by the desire to keep at least some of the Lorentz invariance unbroken A nonvanishing fermion is not invariant under any part of the Lorentz group The values of the metric vector fields and scalar fields then determine the type of solution that we are discussing These may be Antide Sitter geometries black holes branes or ppwaves or Minkowski spaces which all preserve some supersymmetry When we discuss preserved supersymmetry this means some rigid supersymmetry There is often a confusing terminology that a solution preserves all supersymmetries What is meant is that from all the local supersymmetries parametrized by OliveGreenepsilonialpha x indicating now as well the spinor index alpha1ldots Delta  as the index i1ldots N for the extension there are specific functions depending on Delta N constant parameters that are invariances of the solution To find preserved supersymmetries we have to consider the transformations of the form beginequation delta OliveGreenepsilon rm

vanishing transformations of the fermions to determine the preserved supersymmetries A solution a bosonic configuration that allows nonzero parameters OliveGreenepsilon  is called a BPS solution The algebra of supersymmetry implies for most of these solutions a cancellation between eg contributions of the energy and of the electromagnetic or other charges This can be seen already fromrefSUSYalgGauge orrefQQextraT For preserved supersymmetries the righthand side should vanish when applied to a solution There are nonzero terms proportional to the energy determined by partial 0phi  and proportional to charges determined by TIphi  In solutions with nonzero gauge fields eg charged black holes the last term ofrefSUSYalgGauge has to cancel the energy while for nonzero scalars the term inrefQQextraT plays this role Thus in any case these solutions satisfy some bounds on charges that are called Bogomolnyi bounds This happens eg for charged black holes in D4 N4 supergravityciteKallosh1992ii The solutions may have electric P and magnetic Q charges They satisfy P2Q2leq M2 where M is the mass of the black hole This bound is automatic for solutions of the supersymmetric theories as a consequence of the algebra and coincides with the requirement of cosmic censorship no naked singularities in spacetime If there is an equality then there are solutions for the 16 functions OliveGreenepsilonialpha x that depend on 4 constant parameters N1 in D4 If moreover either P or Q is zero then there are 8 solutions N2 sectionScalars and geometry labelssscalGeom We finish these lectures by giving an overview of the geometries that appear in the scalar manifolds as explained in sectionrefssactions The type of geometries that occur depend on the number of supercharges For all the theories with more than 8 supersymmetries all the scalar manifolds are symmetric spaces These are shown in tablereftblgeometriesPlus8 For the theories with 4 supersymmetries N1 in 4 dimensions but one might also consider lowerdimensional theories the manifold can be an arbitrary Kahler geometry a geometry with a closed complex structure The symmetric Kahler spaces are

supergravity to matter multiplets in D6citeBergshoeff1986mzRiccioni2001bg D5citeCeresole2000jd and D4citedeWit1985pxAndrianopoli1997cm There exist also versions of these geometries for rigid supersymmetry leading to rigid Kahler manifoldsciteSierra1983ccGates1984py and hyperkahler manifolds Another new aspect which has shown recentlyciteBergshoeff2002qk is the possibility of generalization of hyperkahler to hypercomplex manifolds for rigid hypermultiplets and of quaternionicKahler to quaternionic manifolds for hypermultiplets in supergravity This generalization involves theories where no invariant metric can be defined Then the field equations do not follow from an action but are determined by nonclosure functions as inrefalgWithTriv but where the last factor is a

fundamental string This theory offers a magnificent framework to study all particles and all interactions Since 1994 there is an extended framework connecting all the superstring theories and supergravities which is called Mtheory Many unexpected connections now emerge every year from the study of superstrings and supergravities increasing continuously our capabilities to construct realistic models to perform calculations on gauge theories to discuss models of cosmology and to connect many different aspects of our knowledge of physics and mathematics For many applications of string theory we just need to know the structure of supergravity theories The elementary particles that emerge from any superstring theory and that are not hidden to us by being extremely massive nicely fit in supergravity theories In this review we will consider supergravity in its own right ie independent of its role in superstring theory We will consider the supergravities with fields that occur in the action up to two derivatives This corresponds only to the first order in an alpha  perturbation theory of superstrings The part of the theory that describes the spinless fields is very illustrative for the structure of such a supergravity theory These scalar fields determine the vacua of the theory In the context of superstring theory they are the moduli of deformations of the compactifying dimensions The scalar fields define a geometry the structure of which determines also a large part of the full action due to the supersymmetry relations We will at the end of this review consider these geometries It turns out that the richest geometric structures are those that appear when there are 8 supersymmetries In the next section we will review the basic ingredients of supergravity theory at the bosonic side the fields that are mostly nforms with gauge transformations and dualities between their field strengths The mechanism of compensating fields will be shown and we will show how Poincare gravity is obtained as a gauge theory The fermionic side is introduced in sectionrefssClifford The possibilities for supersymmetries are determined by a table of Clifford algebras with specific properties The classification of these lead to a map of possible supergravities and supersymmetric theories that is explained in sectionrefssmapsusy We can divide the discussion on supergravity theories in 4 steps First in sectionrefsssalgebra we consider the algebra of the transformations that leave the action invariant We discuss the superPoincare algebra but also generalizations as central charges the antide Sitter algebra the conformal algebra and their supersymmetric extensions Apart from the spacetime symmetries and the supersymmetries other bosonic gauge symmetries play a role In particular there is the Rsymmetry for which the supersymmetries form a nontrivial representation At the end of this section we show how these algebras are used in constructing supergravity theories The second step sectionrefssmultiplets brings in the fields as representations of the algebra Such a set of fields is a emphmultiplet and there is a balance between bosonic and fermionic fields with an emphonshell counting but often also with an emphoffshell counting We first explain this difference and then discuss the most important multiplet in various dimensions and with various supersymmetry extensions In sectionrefssactions we look at the third step the construction of an action and its properties We explain the duality transformations in 4 dimensions and how the kinetic terms of the scalars determine a scalar geometry We summarize how isometries generalize to hidden symmetries of the action often related to duality transformations and how a subgroup of them can be gauged The final step sectionrefsssolutions involves the properties of some solutions of the supergravity theories The concept of BPS solutions will appear with charges that are at the boundary of an allowed domain As mentioned the scalars of supergravity theories define a geometry and their kinetic terms in the action determine a metric Often these are symmetric spaces An interesting subclass of supergravities those with 8 supersymmetries define emphspecial geometries which can be real Kahler or quaternionic manifolds These geometric aspects are reviewed in sectionrefssscalGeom before concluding with some final remarks in sectionrefssfinal sectionThe ingredients fields and gauge symmetry labelssbosIngred The bosonic fields that occur in supergravity theories are mostly antisymmetric tensors ie components of nforms with gauge symmetries There are exceptions but for most theories one can restrict to these types of bosonic fields We will repeat the relevant general formulae for gauge theories These fields determine massless particles Masses for fields with spin 1 or higher appear by considering spontaneously broken symmetries The construction of Poincare gravity as a gauge theory needs already a special treatment Symmetries in field theories should be distinguished in different categories The simplest ones are emphrigid symmetries These are transformations of the fields with a parameter say Lambda  that is the same everywhere in spacetime Eg a rotation of the reference frame is such a transformation The second type are the emphlocal symmetries or emphgauge symmetries where this parameter can be taken differently in any point of spacetime Lambda x where x denotes the spacetime point Furthermore one should say what is left invariant under symmetries One can consider symmetries of the action symmetries of field equations transforming a field equation in a linear combination of field equations or symmetries of solutions A symmetry of the action will also be a symmetry of the field equations but the reverse is not necessarily true Such symmetries are not necessarily symmetries of a solution and that is the concept of a emphspontaneously broken symmetry We now restrict ourselves to symmetries of the action When we consider a rigid symmetry and try to promote it to a local symmetry the action S will in general not be invariant due to terms that show the xdependence of the parameter ie delta S is proportional to partial mu Lambda x beginequation delta Lambda  S int rmdDx Jmupartial mu Lambda x labeldelSJdLambda

delta Amux partial mu Lambda x labelSwithA endequation This is the first step in an iterative procedure to construct invariant actions Noether procedure The simplest example of a gauge field is the Maxwell field that appears when promoting phase transformations of complex fields that are proportional to their electric charges to a local symmetry The gauge field induces a force between the particles that transform under the symmetry Apart from the scalar fields all bosonic fields that appear here are gauge fields The Maxwell field above can be seen as a 1form AAmu rmd xmu  and its transformation is delta Armd Lambda The other bosonic fields will be nforms An with a symmetry parameter that is an n1 form delta Anrmd Lambdan1 Not all the components of Lambdan1frac1n1 Lambda mu 1ldots mu n1rmd xmu 1ldots rmd xmu n1 are independent symmetries as all transformations where Lambdan1rmd Lambda primen2 are not effective Counting the remaining gaugeinvariant components of an n form gives beginequation Dchoose n  D choose n1  D choose n2  ldots  D1choose n labelcompnform endequation the number of components of an nform in D1 dimensions This is a general feature the independent components form a representation of SOD1 If furthermore the field equations of massless fields are used the independent components form representations of SOD2 The former is called emphoffshell counting while the latter is called emphonshell counting  The number of offshell components is also equal to the number of components of a massive field Indeed the massive physical fields are also characterized by SOD1 representations as that is the little group for a massive state while SOD2 is the little group of massless states The gauge invariant degrees of freedom for an n form reside in an n1form field strength Fn1rmd An This obviously satisfies a Bianchi identity rmd Fn10 while for the standard Lagrangian proportional to Fmu 1ldots mu n1Fmu 1ldots mu n1  the field equation gives rmd F0 This shows that  F satisfies the same equations as a Bianchi identity for a Dn1form field strength Thus it can be considered as the field strength of a Dn2form This shows the emphduality between nforms and Dn2forms Eg in 4 dimensions this shows that a 2form gives physically the same as a scalar and we can thus restrict ourselves to scalars and vectors However the arguments above are only true for the simplest actions ie with abelian gauge fields In nonabelian field theories antisymmetric tensors can lead to nonequivalent theories The duality transformations on vectors is a emphselfduality between the components of the field strengths Fmu nu  and transforms electric in magnetic components The usual gauge symmetries with 1form gauge fields are the most important ingredients of supergravity theories For a set of gauge transformations labelled by an index A we write the transformations as deltaA Lambda A where Lambda Ax denote the parameters They form an algebra as

never broken but acts only on the field that is not present anymore in the action after this redefinition If we try to mimic the gauge theory procedure for gravity we should consider the Poincare

You can see this either from the fact that the transformation of the spin connection now follows from its new definition or from the fact that the transformation should be adapted such thatrefconstrRP is invariant This deforms the algebra The result is very nice the translation operation is replaced by a general coordinate transformation on all fields In this way a gauge theory of general coordinate transformations is obtained and this is Einsteins theory sectionThe guide Clifford algebra representations labelssClifford We now turn our attention to the fermions Therefore we first of all have to know which Clifford representations we can use This information determines also the amount of supersymmetry that can be present in any dimension What do we have to know Essentially we need

can be found in many places We refer especially tocitesection3VanProeyen1999ni which has all the arguments in the conventions that are used here Of course that material is not original and is rather a convenient reformulation of earlier works Another recent approach to the theory of spinors has been presented inciteDAuria2000ec which is convenient also for understanding the supersymmetry algebras

are the reduced spinors under such a projection thus eg a lefthanded spinor which satisfies PLPsi Psi  This concept chirality thus only makes sense in even dimensions One may consider the possibilities for reducing the complex spinors to spinors that satisfy a reality condition Psi BPsi  for a suitable matrix B This should be consistent with the Lorentz algebra which is only possible in some dimensions and this depends also on the spacetime signature The corresponding reduced spinors are called emphMajorana spinors If this is not possible one needs a doublet of spinors to define reality conditions In that case the reality conditions do not really reduce the number of independent components of a spinor but the formulation with doublets of real spinors shows more explicitly the symmetry structure These spinors are denoted as emphsymplectic Majorana spinors The reality condition is not always compatible with the Weyl projection If the reality condition can be imposed on Weyl spinors the corresponding irreducible representations of the Lorentz algebra are denoted as emphMajoranaWeyl spinors and have only 2D21 components This leads to tablereftblspinors begintablehtbp

dimensions and supersymmetries labelssmapsusy Tablereftblmapsusy gives an overview on supersymmetric theories in Minkowski spacetimes and with positive definite kinetic terms The most relevant source in this respect is the paper of StrathdeeciteStrathdee1987jr that analyses the representations of supersymmetries Supersymmetric field theories of this type in 4 dimensions are restricted to fields with spins leq 2 This is the restriction to Nleq 8 or up to 32 supersymmetries as an elementary real spinor in 4 dimensions has 4 components see tablereftblspinors The same table shows that one can not have more than 11 dimensions if the supersymmetries are restricted to 32 at least in spacetimes of Minkowski signatureciteNahm1978tg  We are considering here the supersymmetries that square to general coordinate transformations Thus not eg the special supersymmetries in the superconformal algebra which have a different role The 11dimensional theoryciteCremmer1978km is the basis of Mtheory and is therefore indicated as M in the table Going down vertically in the table is obtained by KaluzaKlein reduction That means that one splits all the fields in representations of the lower dimensional Lorentz group Eg the spinors of the 11dimensional Mtheory split in one righthanded and one lefthanded spinor This is the theory of the massless sector of IIA string theory and that is why we have indicated it as IIAciteCampbell1984zcHuq1985imGiani1984wc The massless sector of IIB theory involves doublets of spinors of the same chirality thus also with 32 real supersymmetries That theoryciteSchwarz1983waSchwarz1983qrHowe1984sr is not the dimensional reduction of an 11dimensional theory as indicated by its place in the table Elementary supersymmetric theories in 10 dimensions involve only 16 supersymmetries They appear in superstring theories with open and closed strings Apart from the supergravity multiplet which involves the graviton one can also have a vector multiplet The existence of the simplest matter multiplets representations of supersymmetry that do not involve the graviton is indicated in the table Vector multiplets involve a vector an elementary spinor and possibly scalars Tensor multiplets involve antisymmetric tensors Amu nu  As explained in sectionrefssbosIngred for dimensions 5 and 4 these are dual to vectors and scalars Therefore tensor multiplets are not explicitly indicated for these lower dimensions Also various representations of the same physical onshell theory are not indicated The nonAbelian aspects are not indicated either Eg the tensor multiplets in 5 dimensions are only dual to vector multiplets when the gauge group is Abelian but we do not indicate it separately here One can have theories with these matter multiplets also for ungauged supersymmetry ie rigid supersymmetry Rigid supersymmetry is only possible with up to 16 supersymmetries Again this can be understood in 4 dimensions because for N4 one needs fields of spinft32 The latter are in field theory only possible when they are gauge fields of a local supersymmetry gravitinos which then need gravitons for the gauge fields of the translations that appear in the commutator of two supersymmetries In the dimensions lower than 10 we indicate the theories by a number N that indicates the symmetry group rotating different supersymmetries The structure will be shown explicitly in the next section For 6 dimensions as in 10 dimensions there are spinors of different chirality and one has to distinguish the number of left and righthanded spinors The simplest case is with 8 supersymmetries They have to be all of the same chirality The theory is then called 10 and would be N2 in the terminology used in 5 dimensions With 16 supersymmetries one can have 11 or 20 These are the analogues of IIA and IIB respectively in 10 dimensions For more supersymmetries there is a subtlety The 21 and 22 theories can be constructed using a metric tensor gmu nu x For the 40 31citeTownsend1984xt or 30 theories this field is not presentciteHull2000zn but is replaced by a more complicated representation of the Lorentz group Thus these theories are different in the sense that they are not based on a dynamical metric tensor If one constructs in 4 dimensions a field theory with N7 then it automatically has an eighth local supersymmetry That is why it is not mentioned in the table Similarly if one constructs a rigid supersymmetric theory with N3 it automatically has a fourth supersymmetry However in this case there is the possibility of having only three of the four local Thus N3 is only meaningful in supergravity This explains the lowest line of the table Finally let me remark that the vectors of the supergravity theories can be gauge vectors for a gauge symmetry that rotates the supersymmetries The last years various new results have been obtained in this directionciteGheerardyn2001jjHull2002wgBergshoeff2002mb Andrianopoli2002mfHull2002cvBergshoeff2002nvAlonsoAlberca2002tb deWit2002vt A complete catalogue of theories is not yet known However we believe that all supersymmetric field theories with a finite number of fields and field equations that are at most quadratic in derivatives belong to one of the entries in tablereftblmapsusy sectionStep 1 Supersymmetry and gauge algebra labelsssalgebra After this overview of possibilities we will now give elementary aspects of the construction of supersymmetric theories The first basic concept is the symmetry group First we clarify the relation between transformations and generators We have already written transformations of fields eg inrefsusyscalar This change of a field is proportional to a parameter epsilon  and we can writefootnoteWe sometimes use spinor indices alpha ldots  in this section For details on the notation seeciteVanProeyen1999ni beginequation delta OliveGreenepsilon OliveGreenepsilon alpha BlueQalpha labeldeltaEpsQ endequation ie the product of the parameter with an operation called the generator of the supersymmetry This operation is for supersymmetry also a fermionic object such that the elementary change of a field is of

can consider four kinds of generalizations The first one is the possibility of central charges as found in the classical work of HaagLopuszanskiSohniusciteHaag1975qh The simplest example is in N2 whererefextSUSY45 can be extended to beginequation left BlueQialpha BlueQjbeta right  gamma mu alpha beta delta ijOliveGreenPmu varepsilon ijleft cal Calpha beta RedZ1 gamma 5alpha beta RedZ2right labelD4N2Z endequation The generators Z1 and Z2 commute with everything else and are thus really central They play an important role when looking for supersymmetric solutions of the theory But the name central charges has been generalized to include other generators that can appear in the anticommutator of supersymmetries Eg in D11 the properties of the spinors allow us to extend the anticommutator ascitevanHolten1982mx beginequation leftBlueQalpha BlueQbeta  rightgammamu alpha beta  OliveGreenPmu gamma mu nu  alpha beta RedZmu nu gamma mu1cdots mu5  alpha beta RedZmu1cdots mu5  labelQQD11 endequation The allowed structures on the righthand side are determined by the last entry in tablereftblspinors remember that this is modulo 4 which thus allows the 5index object The central charges RedZ are no longer Lorentz scalars and thus do not commute with the Lorentz generators They are therefore not central in the grouptheoretical meaning of the word but play in the physical context the same role as the ones inrefD4N2Z and therefore got the same name A second generalization is the extension of the Poincare group to the anti de Sitter group The spacetime with a cosmological constant is a curved space which means that translations do not commute but satisfy an algebra beginequation left OliveGreenPmu OliveGreenPnu right mp frac12R2OliveGreenMmu nu  labelAdSalgebra endequation where R is related to the inverse of the cosmological constant The sign inrefAdSalgebra determines the sign of the cosmological constant and correspondingly whether the algebra of translations and Lorentz rotations is SOD1 or SOD12 The first one is the de Sitter algebra while the second one is the antide Sitter algebra Extending the first one to a superalgebra needs a noncompact Rsymmetry group which in turn needs negative kinetic terms of some of the fields an undesirable feature But supersymmetric extensions of antide Sitter algebras are wellknown see the classical work of NahmciteNahm1978tg or a recent investigation inciteDAuria2000ec The third generalization is to superconformal algebras The conformal group is the group consisting of translations BluePmu Lorentz rotations BlueMmu nu  dilatations BlueD and special conformal transformations BlueKmu which combine to SOD2 If one extends it with supersymmetries RedQi the algebra requires for consistency new special supersymmetries RedSi in the commutator QK and the Rsymmetry group mentioned above appears in the anticommutator of the RedQ and RedS supersymmetries The fourth generalization is to include extra YangMills YM gauge symmetries Indeed the spin1 fields that appear either in the supergravity multiplet or in the extra vector multiplets may gauge YM symmetries according to the principles expressed byrefcovder When the replacement of derivatives by covariant derivatives is performed everywhere it is clear that one will not obtain the commutator as inrefsusyalgscalar but rather beginequation left deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 1deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 2right Bluephi OliveGreenbar epsilon 1gamma mu OliveGreenepsilon 2Dmu Bluephi OliveGreenbar epsilon 1gamma mu

parameter OliveGreenbar epsilon 1gamma mu OliveGreenepsilon 2 BlueAmu I Therefore gamma mualpha beta  BlueAmu I is a fielddependent emphstructure function rather than a structure constant This type of algebra structure appears often in supersymmetry and is called a emphsoft algebra The adapted Jacobi identities then imply that more modifications to the algebra are necessary Eg in N2 where the vector multiplets contain scalars sigma I the algebra has an extra term beginequation left deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 1deltaQ OliveGreenepsilon 2right Bluephi ldots  OliveGreenbar epsilon 1OliveGreenepsilon 2Bluesigma I TIBluephi labelQQextraT endequation When the fields sigma I have a nonzero value for a solution of the theory then the algebra that preserves this solution has the form ofrefD4N2Z ie with central charges This illustrates how the first generalization that we discussed above appears in solutions of the supergravity theories Also the second generalization superantide Sitter algebras occurs in solutions The third and fourth generalization on the other hand are important in constructing supergravity theories subsectionConstructionslabelssconstruction In constructing rigid supersymmetric theories we start from a rigid Poincare supersymmetry ie the Poincare symmetries supersymmetry and its R symmetries Then a YM gauge algebra can be addedfootnoteIn principle also gauge symmetries of antisymmetric tensors can be included which may also have an action on the other fields We neglect these here for simplicity but the principles are the same as for the YM symmetries gauged by vectors which are parts of a vector multiplet The algebra becomes then soft and the rigid supersymmetries mix with the local YM symmetries as shown inrefSUSYalgGauge In some cases the action can be invariant under rigid superconformal symmetries Central charges are not introduced by hand but may appear due to the mixing of supersymmetry with YM symmetries and nonzero vacuum expectation values of some fields seerefQQextraT To construct supergravity theories there is first a straightforward way superPoincare way One gauges gravity and supersymmetry The invariance requirements determine all the terms as well in the Lagrangian as in the transformation laws The alternative way called superconformal tensor calculus is particularly useful to construct theories with matter couplings ie where matter multiplets are coupled to supergravity The superPoincare construction leads to a lot of extra terms which can be better understood in the context of the superconformal tensor calculus The latter starts by gauging the full superconformal algebra This is a generalization of the method used to gauge the Poincare group at the end of sectionrefssbosIngred gauge fields are associated to all the symmetries as inrefgravitygaugef but some of these are dependent fields using constraints on curvatures as inrefconstrRP Then an action is constructed that is invariant under the superconformal symmetries but the symmetries that are superfluous are gaugefixed This is similar to the construction of the Lagrangian for a massive vector where inrefL10 we constructed an action invariant under a gauge symmetry which was then fixed to obtain the massive vector action inrefLmassive1 For the superconformal symmetry this means that dilatations special conformal transformations special supersymmetry and the Rsymmetry should be gaugefixed to obtain an action that is invariant under the superPoincare group We thus need fields that will not be physical as the scalar phi  inrefL10 but are emphcompensating for the symmetries in the superconformal algebra that do not belong to the superPoincare algebra They are part of emphcompensating multiplets as they have to be in supersymmetric representations Also the fourth generalization has to be considered in the construction of general actions vectors in the supergravity multiplet and vector multiplets can gauge an extra YM gauge group In the superPoincare construction one considers separately the Rsymmetries and other YM symmetries One has to define the action of Rsymmetry on all the fields in the theory In the superconformal tensor calculus only vectors of vector multiplets can gauge an extra gauge symmetry G commuting with supersymmetry But one of these vector multiplets may be the compensating multiplet mentioned above That means that some of its partners are fields that disappear by gauge conditions The vectors are the extra vectors that appear in the gravity multiplet from the superPoincare theory Also the Rsymmetry is already gauged in the superconformal context as it is part of the superconformal group but is afterwards gaugefixed However the gauge fixing condition may be not invariant under some of the extra YM gauge symmetries mixing Rsymmetry and G Schematically we have begineqnarray mboxsuperconformal including R  times   G nonumber  Downarrow  mboxgauge fixingnonumber mboxsuperPoincare mboxwith G labelmixingSPSC endeqnarray where G is G with a mixing of superconformal Rsymmetries Therefore part of G does not commute with the supersymmetries and acts as a gauged

some more details distinguishing on and offshell multiplets and then giving the properties of the unique multiplets when there are 32 supersymmetries the vector multiplets and the multiplets with

algebrarefminSUSYalg is satisfied onshell ie when the field equations are imposed There is a possible improvement here we can include emphauxiliary fields Redh complex This means that we modify the

other Lagrangians invariant under the same transformation laws Indeed one can eg add to the Lagrangian a term beginequation cal Lmmleft BluezRedhBluezRedhBluebar chi chi right labelLchiralm endequation The Lagrangian is still invariant The field equation of the auxiliary field is now RedhmBluez which lead to massive scalar and spinor fields Of course in the formulation without auxiliary fields one has to modify the transformation laws to allow such an extension as the last term inrefalgChiral would not be a field equation any more Therefore when such a formalism with auxiliary fields is possible it is certainly easier to handle also for considering the quantum theory The formalism with auxiliary fields can also be obtained from the concept of superspace and superfields However unfortunately it is not always possible to obtain such auxiliary fields In general trivial symmetries can be considered as part of the full set of transformations of the theory and as such it makes sense to write the algebra beginequation left delta OliveGreenepsilon 1delta OliveGreenepsilon 2right Bluephii mboxminimal susy algebraRedeta ijOliveGreenepsilon 1epsilon 2fracdelta Sdelta Bluephi j labelalgWithTriv endequation When we can write the algebra without including the trivial symmetries the algebra is called a emphclosed supersymmetry algebra If the trivial symmetries enter the algebra then it is called an emphopen supersymmetry algebra In that case the algebra closes when the field equations are satisfied or when the infinite set of trivial symmetries are included Thus in this case the dynamics can be obtained already from the algebra of supersymmetry transformations before constructing the action The square of the supersymmetry operation is in the minimal algebrarefminSUSYalg a general coordinate transformation This is an invertible operation As the supersymmetry operation transforms boson in fermion states and viceversa one can conclude that the number of boson and fermion states should be the same This is thus true when the algebra of supersymmetries gives just OliveGreenP Eg with the transformationsreftransfosChiralM and algebrarefalgChiral we can apply this only for onshell states such that slashedpartial Bluechi 0 Then we count 2 bosonic states for the complex Bluez and the 4 fermionic components of Bluechi  are reduced to 2 by the field equation So we have a 22 onshell multiplet When the auxiliary field Redh is included the algebra is also satisfied offshell Thus we have in this case the 4 components of Bluechi  and Bluez and Redh give together also 4 components In this case we say that we have a 44 offshell multiplet These two ways of counting are called emphonshell counting and emphoffshell counting Let me finally remark that to have the minimal algebra we have to eliminate the extra gauge terms that we illustrated inrefSUSYalgGauge Thus we always have to subtract gauge degrees of freedom in all countings Eg a gauge vector in 4 dimensions would count offshell for 3 degrees of freedom and onshell for 2 degrees of freedom representation of SOD2 see sectionrefssbosIngred We now give some general facts about the most important multiplets

supersymmetry supergravity The vectors in the vector multiplets and those in the gravity multiplets can gauge an extra possibly nonAbelian gauge group In rigid supersymmetry one can only have compact gauge groups if one requires positive kinetic energies but in supergravity some noncompact gauge groups are possible without spoiling the positivity of the kinetic energies However the list of possible noncompact groups is restricted for any N A number of hypermultiplets N2 or chiral multiplets N1 may then form a representation of these gauge groups When there are 32 supersymmetries the multiplet is unique and this multiplet is only known onshell ie it is not known and there are nogo theorems how to add auxiliary fields to obtain offshell closure The basic multiplet in 11 dimensions is written in terms of just 3 fields a graviton Maroongmu nu  44 components as traceless symmetric tensor of SO9 an antisymmetric MaroonAmu nu rho  84 components and a vectorspinor Redpsi mu build the 128128 multiplet Reducing this eg to D4 fields gives the N8 multiplet in tablereftblpureSGD4 With 16 supersymmetries rigid supersymmetry is possible One can have vector multiplets or tensor multiplets for 20 supersymmetry in 6 dimensions In D5 the tensor multiplets are dual to vector multiplets at the level of zero gauge coupling constant Gauging breaks this duality Supergravity theories with 16 supersymmetries may contain a number of these multiplets The model is fixed once one gives the number of matter multiplets and the gauging that is performed by the vectors Theories with 8 or 4 supersymmetries are not fixed by the discrete choices of number of multiplets and gauging In these cases the model depends on some functions that can vary by infinitesimal variations It is in these models that auxiliary fields are most useful Eg for the chiral multiplets that we mentioned before a holomorphic function OliveGreenWBluez can be introduced which may take arbitrary values determining a potential Indeed the additionrefLchiralm can be generalized to beginequation cal LW fracpartial OliveGreenWBluezpartial BluezRedh fracpartial 2OliveGreenWBluezpartial Bluez2Bluebar chi PL Bluechi hc  labelLchiralW endequation Similarly the kinetic terms can be generalized depending on an arbitrary function cal Gzz which will play the role of a Kahler potential for the geometry determined by the scalars see sectionrefssscalGeom sectionStep 3 Actions labelssactions The next step is the determination of the action There are some general properties of actions that we will show in this section The kinetic terms of the scalars determine a geometry There is also a potential for these scalars with properties that are determined by the supersymmetry The kinetic terms of the vectors introduce the duality symmetries which by supersymmetry imply symmetries on the full theory leading often to hidden symmetries of the scalar geometry The full action of a supergravity theory is very complicated It contains 4fermion couplings couplings between fermions and vectors as dipole moments ldots  We show here some general structure of the bosonic terms in 4 dimensions The theory containsfootnoteWe neglect here the possibility of additional antisymmetric tensors though it is not proven whether all theories with antisymmetric tensors have an equivalent description in terms of scalars the graviton

RedguvvarphiDmu Redvarphiu Dmu Redvarphiv MaroonVRedvarphi labelgeneralbosL endeqnarray We factorized the determinant of the vierbein to the left hand side The first term gives the pure gravity action Then there are the kinetic terms for the spin1 fields They depend on two tensor functions which we combine in a complex symmetric tensor Redcal NIJ This tensor in general is a function of the scalars in the theory The scalars have kinetic terms determined by a symmetric tensor Redguvvarphi They couple minimally to the vectors with a covariant derivative for the gauge symmetries as inrefcovder Finally there is the potential MaroonVRedvarphi We will now illustrate the duality transformations in D4 generalizations of the Maxwell dualitiesfootnoteAspects of dualities and gaugings in arbitrary dimensions are treated inciteFre2001jd They were first discussed inciteFerrara1977iqdeWit1979shCremmer1979upGaillard1981rj They apply only for Abelian theories and without the coupling of the vectors to other fields Thus eg we neglect the appearance of the vector in covariant derivative of the scalars inrefgeneralbosL The vectors then appear in the action only as their field strengths If we express the theory in terms of field strengths we have to complement the field equations with Bianchi identities varepsilon mu nu rho sigma partialmumathcalFrho sigma0 But there is a convenient way to

conclusion that mathcalS should be in Symp2mmathbbR Thus the vector field strengths belong to 2msymplectic vectors To understand the scalar geometry we have to distinguish 2 manifolds On the one hand there is the spacetime with coordinates xmu  mu 0123 On the other hand there is a manifold which we indicate as cal M with dimension equal to the number of scalars in the model The scalars Redvarphiu give a chart in this manifold The values of a scalar at a spacetime point x thus determine a submanifold of cal M parametrized by Redvarphiux The metric of spacetime is gmu nu xemu ax eta ab enu bx The metric on cal M is Redguvvarphi These have a different status While the latter is part of the definition of the theory gmu nu x is together with Redvarphiux a dynamical field On the other hand the induced metric on spacetime is Redguvvarphi partial mu Redvarphi upartial nu Redvarphi v at varphi varphi x and its contraction with the inverse spacetime metric and its determinant sqrtggmu nu  appears in the action The scalar manifold can have isometries ie symmetries of the induced metric rmd s2Redguvvarphi rmd Redvarphi urmd Redvarphi v Usually these symmetries are extended to a symmetry of the full action there are counterexamples but they are rare This group is then called the emphUduality group The scalars and the vectors are connected via the tensor RedmathcalNIJvarphi  Therefore the isometries act as duality transformations in the vector sector and as such must belong to the Symp2mmathbbR group in 4 dimensions This gives a restriction of possible Uduality groups which are for D4 restricted to be a subgroup of Symp2mmathbbR for scalars that belong to multiplets including vectors Actually to count the m vectors we have to include those of the gravity multiplet This is natural in superconformal tensor calculus where these vectors belong to vector multiplets of which part of the fields are compensating fields see sectionrefssconstruction A subgroup of the isometry group at most of dimension m can then be gauged This means that the vectors couple to the scalars in the covariant derivative using inrefcovder the transformations of the scalars under these isometries There are more corrections due to this gauging in the fermionic sector We will give more details on the geometries in sectionrefssscalGeom but first finish the overview of the different steps of the analysis of supersymmetric theories sectionStep 4 Solutions and their symmetry labelsssolutions We usually look for solutions with vanishing fermions This is often motivated by the desire to keep at least some of the Lorentz invariance unbroken A nonvanishing fermion is not invariant under any part of the Lorentz group The values of the metric vector fields and scalar fields then determine the type of solution that we are discussing These may be Antide Sitter geometries black holes branes or ppwaves or Minkowski spaces which all preserve some supersymmetry When we discuss preserved supersymmetry this means some rigid supersymmetry There is often a confusing terminology that a solution preserves all supersymmetries What is meant is that from all the local supersymmetries parametrized by OliveGreenepsilonialpha x indicating now as well the spinor index alpha1ldots Delta  as the index i1ldots N for the extension there are specific functions depending on Delta N constant parameters that are invariances of the solution To find preserved supersymmetries we have to consider the transformations of the form beginequation delta OliveGreenepsilon rm bosonOliveGreenepsilon textrmfermionqquad delta OliveGreenepsilon rm fermionOliveGreenepsilon textrmboson labeldelbosonfermion endequation For vanishing fermions we have to consider the condition of vanishing transformations of the fermions to determine the preserved supersymmetries A solution a bosonic configuration that allows nonzero parameters OliveGreenepsilon  is called a BPS solution The algebra of supersymmetry implies for most of these solutions a cancellation between eg contributions of the energy and of the electromagnetic or other charges This can be seen already fromrefSUSYalgGauge orrefQQextraT For preserved supersymmetries the righthand side should vanish when applied to a solution There are nonzero terms proportional to the energy determined by partial 0phi  and proportional to charges determined by TIphi  In solutions with nonzero gauge fields eg charged black holes the last term ofrefSUSYalgGauge has to cancel the energy while for nonzero scalars the term inrefQQextraT plays this role Thus in any case these solutions satisfy some bounds on charges that are called Bogomolnyi bounds This happens eg for charged black holes in D4 N4 supergravityciteKallosh1992ii The solutions may have electric P and magnetic Q charges They satisfy P2Q2leq M2 where M is the mass of the black hole This bound is automatic for solutions of the supersymmetric theories as a consequence of the algebra and coincides with the requirement of cosmic censorship no naked singularities in spacetime If there is an equality then there are solutions for the 16 functions OliveGreenepsilonialpha x that depend on 4 constant parameters N1 in D4 If moreover either P or Q is zero then there are 8 solutions N2 sectionScalars and geometry labelssscalGeom We finish these lectures by giving an overview of the geometries that appear in the scalar manifolds as explained in sectionrefssactions The type of geometries that occur depend on the number of supercharges For all the theories with more than 8 supersymmetries all the scalar manifolds are symmetric spaces These are shown in tablereftblgeometriesPlus8 For the theories with 4 supersymmetries N1 in 4 dimensions but one might also consider lowerdimensional theories the manifold can be an arbitrary Kahler geometry a geometry with a closed complex structure The symmetric Kahler spaces are

endeqnarray Arbitrary Kahler spaces are defined by a Kahler potential cal Gzz mentioned at the end of sectionrefssmultiplets For any Kahler manifold there is such an N1 theory Beautiful structures emerge for theories with 8 supercharges N2 if in D4 These theories all belong to a class that was baptized emphspecial geometriesciteStrominger1990pddeWit1992cr including some realciteGunaydin1984bi some Kahler geometriescitedeWit1984pk and all the quaternionic geometriesciteBagger1983tt Especially the scalars that by supersymmetry are directly related to vectors have a geometrically distinct structure special Kahler geometrycitedeWit1984pk This is a subclass of the Kahler geometries discussed above with an extra symplectic symmetry structure related to the duality transformations of the vectors shown in sectionrefssactions Scalars in hypermultiplets exhibit quaternionic structures with many relations with special Kahler manifoldsciteCecotti1989qndeWit1993wf Specifically the manifolds

and3 where tables are given of the symmetric special geometries and homogeneous special geometries Indeed the work on these couplings lead to new mathematical discoveries in the field of quaternionic geometrycitedeWit1992nmdeWit1995tf especially an improvement on the classification of homogeneous quaternionic geometriesciteAlekseevsky1975 These geometries determine the general couplings of supergravity to matter multiplets in D6citeBergshoeff1986mzRiccioni2001bg D5citeCeresole2000jd and D4citedeWit1985pxAndrianopoli1997cm There exist also versions of these geometries for rigid supersymmetry leading to rigid Kahler manifoldsciteSierra1983ccGates1984py and hyperkahler manifolds Another new aspect which has shown recentlyciteBergshoeff2002qk is the possibility of generalization of hyperkahler to hypercomplex manifolds for rigid hypermultiplets and of quaternionicKahler to quaternionic manifolds for hypermultiplets in supergravity This generalization involves theories where no invariant metric can be defined Then the field equations do not follow from an action but are determined by nonclosure functions as inrefalgWithTriv but where the last factor is a dynamical equation Ej that can not be written as the derivative of some action Ejneq fracdelta Sdelta Bluephi j sectionFinal remarks labelssfinal We know a lot of the general structure of supergravity theories but still new aspects of supergravity theories are discovered every day They lead to interesting applications in phenomenology and even cosmology these days For those who want to study further the aspects of supergravity theories we refer to the recent longer review of BdeWitcitedeWit2002vz landscape begintablehtbp captionit Scalar geometries in theories with more than 8
