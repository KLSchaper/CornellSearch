      "Supergravity is now mostly known as an ingredient of superstring theory,\n",
      "the theory that tells that the elementary particles are vibrations of a\n",
      "fundamental string. This theory offers a magnificent framework to study\n",
      "all particles and all interactions. Since 1994 there is an extended\n",
      "framework connecting all the superstring theories and supergravities,\n",
      "which is called M-theory. Many unexpected connections now emerge every\n",
      "year from the study of superstrings and supergravities, increasing\n",
      "continuously our capabilities to construct realistic models, to perform\n",
      "calculations on gauge theories, to discuss models of cosmology and to\n",
      "connect many different aspects of our knowledge of physics and\n",
      "mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many applications of string theory we just need to know the structure\n",
      "of supergravity theories. The elementary particles that emerge from any\n",
      "superstring theory and that are not hidden to us by being extremely\n",
      "massive, nicely fit in supergravity theories. In this review, we will\n",
      "consider supergravity in its own right, i.e.\\ independent of its role in\n",
      "superstring theory. We will consider the supergravities with fields that\n",
      "occur in the action up to two derivatives. This corresponds only to the\n",
      "first order in an $\\alpha '$ perturbation theory of superstrings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The part of the theory that describes the spinless fields is very\n",
      "illustrative for the structure of such a supergravity theory. These\n",
      "scalar fields determine the vacua of the theory. In the context of\n",
      "superstring theory they are the moduli of deformations of the\n",
      "compactifying dimensions. The scalar fields define a geometry, the\n",
      "structure of which determines also a large part of the full action due to\n",
      "the supersymmetry relations. We will at the end of this review consider\n",
      "these geometries. It turns out that the richest geometric structures are\n",
      "those that appear when there are 8 supersymmetries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next section, we will review the basic ingredients of supergravity\n",
      "theory at the bosonic side: the fields that are mostly $n$-forms with\n",
      "gauge transformations, and dualities between their field strengths. The\n",
      "mechanism of compensating fields will be shown and we will show how\n",
      "Poincar{\\'e} gravity is obtained as a gauge theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fermionic side is introduced in section~\\ref{ss:Clifford}. The\n",
      "possibilities for supersymmetries are determined by a table of Clifford\n",
      "algebras with specific properties. The classification of these lead to a\n",
      "map of possible supergravities and supersymmetric theories that is\n",
      "explained in section~\\ref{ss:mapsusy}.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can divide the discussion on supergravity theories in 4 steps. First,\n",
      "in section~\\ref{ss:salgebra}, we consider the algebra of the\n",
      "transformations that leave the action invariant. We discuss the\n",
      "super-Poincar{\\'e} algebra, but also generalizations as central charges, the\n",
      "(anti-)de Sitter algebra, the conformal algebra and their supersymmetric\n",
      "extensions. Apart from the spacetime symmetries and the supersymmetries,\n",
      "other bosonic gauge symmetries play a role. In particular there is the\n",
      "R-symmetry, for which the supersymmetries form a non-trivial\n",
      "representation. At the end of this section we show how these algebras are\n",
      "used in constructing supergravity theories\n",
      "\n",
      "The second step (section~\\ref{ss:multiplets}) brings in the fields as\n",
      "representations of the algebra. Such a set of fields is a\n",
      "\\emph{multiplet}, and there is a balance between bosonic and fermionic\n",
      "fields with an \\emph{on-shell counting}, but often also with an\n",
      "\\emph{off-shell counting}. We first explain this difference, and then\n",
      "discuss the most important multiplet in various dimensions and with\n",
      "various supersymmetry extensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In section~\\ref{ss:actions} we look at the third step: the construction\n",
      "of an action and its properties. We explain the duality transformations\n",
      "in 4 dimensions, and how the kinetic terms of the scalars determine a\n",
      "scalar geometry. We summarize how isometries generalize to hidden\n",
      "symmetries of the action, often related to duality transformations, and\n",
      "how a subgroup of them can be gauged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final step (section~\\ref{ss:solutions}) involves the properties of\n",
      "some solutions of the supergravity theories. The concept of BPS solutions\n",
      "will appear, with charges that are at the boundary of an allowed domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned, the scalars of supergravity theories define a geometry, and\n",
      "their kinetic terms in the action determine a metric. Often these are\n",
      "symmetric spaces. An interesting subclass of supergravities, those with 8\n",
      "supersymmetries, define \\emph{special geometries}, which can be real,\n",
